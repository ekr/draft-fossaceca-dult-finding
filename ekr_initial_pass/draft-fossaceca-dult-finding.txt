                  draft-fossaceca-dult-finding-latest

Abstract

   Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to
   locate items.  These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced
   tracking network in which devices belonging to other network users
   (e.g., phones) report which tags they see and their location, thus
   allowing the owner of the tag to determine where their tag was most
   recently seen.  This document defines the protocol by which devices
   report tags they have seen and by which owners look up their
   location.

1.  Introduction

   Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to
   locate items.  These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced
   tracking network in which devices belonging to other network users
   (e.g., phones) report on the location of tags they have seen.  At a
   high level, this works as follows:

   *  Tags ("accessories") broadcast an advertisement payload containing
      accessory-specific information.  The payload also indicates
      whether the accessory is separated from its owner and thus
      potentially lost.

   *  Devices belonging to other users ("non-owner devices") observe
      those payloads and if the payload is in a separated mode, reports
      its location to some central service.

   *  The owner queries the central service for the location of their
      accessory.

   A naive implementation of this design exposes users to considerable
   privacy risk.  In particular:

   *  If accessories simply have a fixed identifier that is reported
      back to the tracking network, then the central server is able to
      track any accessory without the user's assistance, which is
      clearly undesirable.

   *  An attacker can surreptitiously plant an accessory on a target and
      thus track them by tracking their "own" accessory.

   Section 4 provides more detailed definition of the desired security
   privacy properties, but briefly, we would like to have a system in
   which:

   1.  Nobody other than the owner of an accessory would be able to
       learn anything about the location of a given accessory.

   2.  It is possible to detect when an accessory is being used to track
       you.

   This document defines a cryptographic reporting and finding protocol
   which is intended to minimize these privacy risks.  It is intended to
   work in concert with the requirements defined in
   [I-D.detecting-unwanted-location-trackers], which facilitate
   detection of unwanted tracking tags.  This protocol design is based
   [TODO: Airtags, BlindMy]

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Section 1.2 of [I-D.detecting-unwanted-location-trackers] provides
   definitions of the various system components.

3.  Protocol Overview

   [TODO: Add Figure]

                        Figure 1: Protocol Overview

   Figure 1 provides an overall view of the protocol.

   As part of the setup phase (not shown) the accessory and owning
   device are paired, establishing a shared key SK which is known to
   both the accessory and the owning device.  The rest of the protocol
   proceeeds as follows.

   *  The accessory periodically sends out an advertisement which
      contains an ephemeral public key Y_i where i is the epoch the key
      is valid for (e.g., a one hour window).  Y_i and its corresponding
      private key X_i are generated in a deterministic fashion from SK
      and the epoch i (conceptually as a X_i = PRF(SK, i)).

   *  In order to report an accessory's location at time i a non-owning
      device encrypts it under Y_i and transmits the pair ( E(Y_i,
      location), Y_i ) to the central service.

   *  In order to locate an accessory at time i, the owner uses SK to
      compute (X_i, Y_i) and then sends Y_i to the central service.  The
      central service responds with all the reports it has for Y_i, and
      the owner decrypts them with X_i.
