The attestation mechanism described in Section [TODO] is intended to mitigate this attack.\r\n\r\nCan we specifically state with this draft that non compliant trackers be locked out from being able to utilize the crowd sourced FindMy networks? We can't stop more sophisticated trackers, but we can at least stop them from being able to use this network. \r\n\r\nForgive me if this is addressed somewhere else.\r\n",
