Abstract

   Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to
   locate items.  These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced
   tracking network in which devices belonging to other network users
   (e.g., phones) report which tags they see and their location, thus
   allowing the owner of the tag to determine where their tag was most
   recently seen.  This document defines the protocol by which devices
   report tags they have seen and by which owners look up their
   location.

1.  Introduction

   Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to
   locate items.  These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced
   tracking network in which devices belonging to other network users
   (e.g., phones) report on the location of tags they have seen.  At a
   high level, this works as follows:

   *  Tags ("accessories") broadcast an advertisement payload containing
      accessory-specific information.  The payload also indicates
      whether the accessory is separated from its owner and thus
      potentially lost.

   *  Devices belonging to other users ("non-owner devices") observe
      those payloads and if the payload is in a separated mode, reports
      its location to some central service.

   *  The owner queries the central service for the location of their
      accessory.

   A naive implementation of this design exposes users to considerable
   privacy risk.  In particular:

   *  If accessories simply have a fixed identifier that is reported
      back to the tracking network, then the central server is able to
      track any accessory without the user's assistance, which is
      clearly undesirable.

   *  An attacker can surreptitiously plant an accessory on a target and
      thus track them by tracking their "own" accessory.

   Section 6 provides more detailed definition of the desired security
   privacy properties, but briefly, we would like to have a system in
   which:

   *  Nobody other than the owner of an accessory would be able to learn
      anything about the location of a given accessory.

   *  It is possible to detect when an accessory is being used to track
      you.

   *  It is not possible for accessories that do not adhere to the
      protocol to use crowdsource network protocol.

   *  It is not possible for unverified accessories to use the
      crowdsource network protocol.

   This document defines a cryptographic reporting and finding protocol
   which is intended to minimize these privacy risks.  It is intended to
   work in concert with the requirements defined in
   [I-D.detecting-unwanted-location-trackers], which facilitate
   detection of unwanted tracking tags.  This protocol design is based
   on existing academic research surrounding the security and privacy of
   bluetooth location tracking accessories on the market today.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Section 1.2 of [I-D.detecting-unwanted-location-trackers] provides
   definitions of the various system components.

   Accessory: This is the device which will be tracked.  It is assumed
   to lack direct internet access and GPS, but will possess Bluetooth
   Low Energy capabilities, which it uses to send advertisement
   messages.

   Advertisement: This is the message that is sent over the BLE Protocol

4.  Protocol Overview

   [TODO: Add Figure]

                        Figure 1: Protocol Overview

   Figure 1 provides an overall view of the protocol.

   In this protocol, the accessory communicates to networked devices
   (such as phones) solely via Bluetooth (TODO, should we generalize
   this for UWB), while networked devices communicate to the centralized
   service.  Only during the setup phase is the owning device able to
   act as a relay between the accessory and the central service.

   We assume that during the setup phase, the communication channel
   between the owning device and the central service is authenticated
   and end-to-end encrypted.

   In this implementation,

   *  All parties agree on an elliptic curve group with a generator, a
      secure Message Authentication Algorithm, and a hashing function H.

   TODO - unsure if the database of used/ unused serial values in a
   central is really that secure, or how it can be abused?

   *  The server knows a key pair (KS , PS ), where the public key PS is
      known to all parties.  In addition, the server has a private
      symmetric encryption key Kserial.  Finally, the server also
      maintains a database of used serial values DSerial.

   *  Each Tracking Device TDj has been initialized with a unique serial
      number and a tag constructed by a secure Message Authentication
      Code (MAC) algorithm applied to the serial, so that each TDj has
      in its internal storage:

   (Serialj, Tj) = MACkserial(Serialj)

   During the setup phase, the accessory and owning device leverage
   partial blind signatures to authenticate the accessory with the
   central service.

   As part of the setup phase (described above) the accessory and owning
   device are paired, establishing a shared key SK which is known to
   both the accessory and the owning device.  The rest of the protocol
   proceeds as follows.

   *  The accessory periodically sends out an advertisement which
      contains an ephemeral public key Y_i where i is the epoch the key
      is valid for (e.g., a one hour window).  Y_i and its corresponding
      private key X_i are generated in a deterministic fashion from SK
      and the epoch i (conceptually as a X_i = PRF(SK, i)).

   *  In order to report an accessory's location at time i a non-owning
      device encrypts it under Y_i and transmits the pair ( E(Y_i,
      location), Y_i ) to the central service.

   *  In order to locate an accessory at time i, the owner uses SK to
      compute (X_i, Y_i) and then sends Y_i to the central service.  The
      central service responds with all the reports it has for Y_i, and
      the owner decrypts them with X_i.
